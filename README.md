# React JS Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **React.js learning repository**! This repo contains all my practice, learning, and personal projects related to React.js.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- ### `react-*` (Example: `react-basics`, `react-hooks`, etc.)
  These folders contain projects and exercises completed **during classes or tutorials**. They are focused on learning core concepts step-by-step, following structured lessons.

- ### `react-*-personal` (Example: `react-basics-personal`, `react-todo-personal`, etc.)
  These folders include projects that I have **built on my own** to apply the concepts learned from class. They reflect my **personal understanding, creativity, and experimentation**.
