# 🚀 React Learning & Projects

Welcome to my React repository! 👋

This repo is a part of my **React learning journey**, where I’m building small to medium-scale projects while learning core concepts of React such as **JSX**, **Components**, **Props**, **State**, **Hooks**, and more.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- 📒 **Concept Practice**: Hands-on practice for each React concept (like JSX, Props, State, Events, etc.)
- 🛠️ **Mini Projects**: Simple projects built while learning (e.g. Counter App, To-Do List)
- 🌱 **Personal Growth**: This repo shows how I’m growing as a frontend developer.

## 🧠 Why I Created This

I believe in **learning by doing**. By uploading my learning code and mini projects here:
- I stay consistent and accountable.
- I track my progress over time.
- Others can learn or give feedback too.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- React (with functional components)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS / Tailwind CSS
